# adaudit
PowerShell Script to perform a quick AD audit. Forked from:
```
_____ ____     _____       _ _ _
|  _  |    \   |  _  |_ _ _| |_| |_
|     |  |  |  |     | | | . | |  _|
|__|__|____/   |__|__|___|___|_|_|

If you have any decent powershell one liners that could be used in the script please let me know. I'm trying to keep this script as a single file with no requirements on external tools (other than ntdsutil and cmd.exe)

Run directly on a DC using a DA. If you don't trust the code I suggest reading it first and you'll see it's all harmless! (But shouldn't you be doing that anyway with code you download off the net and then run as DA??)
